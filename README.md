Arduino-Compatible Microcontroller with Enhanced Features
Introduction
Have you ever struggled to find the correct cable for programming your Arduino? Do you frequently use I2C LCDs as interfaces for your projects? Have you wished for built-in buttons to test your program's logic? If so, this Arduino-compatible microcontroller addresses these exact issues. It's a solution tailored for tech enthusiasts and makers like us.

Description
This UNO (Type-C and Micro port) compatible microcontroller board is a compatible variant of the Arduino UNO, utilizing the 8-bit ATmega328P microcontroller. Featuring a RISC architecture, it operates at a maximum clock speed of 16MHz. With 32KB of flash memory for code storage and 2KB of SRAM, supplemented by an additional 1KB of EEPROM, it offers ample memory resources. Boasting a total of 20 GPIOs along with 2 analog inputs, all accessible via standard 2.54mm-pitched female pin headers and tactile buttons, it ensures versatility in connectivity. While closely resembling the Arduino Uno R3 in design, it incorporates several enhancements. Fully compatible with the Arduino Software/IDE, it seamlessly integrates with various applications, hardware, and sketches designed for the Arduino Uno. Essentially, it embodies all the standard features of the Arduino Uno, with the added benefit of expanded functionality.

Updates and Enhancements
USB Type-C and Micro-B Programming Interface: Updated the old and bulky USB-B interface to more common USB types, providing interchangeability for programming.

LEDs Positioned for Easier Access: LEDs have been moved to the side of the microcontroller for convenient visibility, especially when using shields.

Upgraded 3.3V Regulator: The 3.3V pin now has a capacity of approximately 800mA, allowing direct powering of certain 3.3V circuits without additional regulators.

Terminal Block Power Connector: Replaced the DC barrel jack with a 5mm terminal block for easier power access.

Multiple 5V Pins: Added multiple 5V pins on the power line to support multiple devices.

CH340G USB-Serial Interface: Replaced the USB-Serial interface with the CH340G, reducing production costs without notable performance disparities.

I2C Header Labelling and Extra Pins: Labelled I2C header pins after pin D13 and added an extra I2C header near pin A5 for quick interface with I2C devices.

Additional Buttons: Added two extra buttons interfaced with pins A6 and A7, configured as pull-down buttons for testing designs.

Crystal Oscillator: Replaced the resonator with a crystal oscillator for higher timing accuracy.
